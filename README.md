This serves as a backend for all of my non firebase related api calls for my portfolio website.
I add any api/logic to this whenever I want to extend functionality to my website.

- Currently, this serves 2 purposes:
  - Leauge of legends data aggregator for custom games between friends.
  - A poorly made auto reservation tool to make reservations for me at specific times when reservations open up for my building.
